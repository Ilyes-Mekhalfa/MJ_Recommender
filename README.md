## 🧠 Recommendation Logic

The recommender follows a simple but powerful logic:

| Step | Description | Data Source |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | Identify user’s selected interests | User profile |
| 2️⃣ | Match events with relevant categories | Event dataset |
| 3️⃣ | Sort by popularity or recency | Global event data |
| 4️⃣ | Return top 10 personalized events | Final recommendation list |

This ensures every user receives both **personalized** and **popular** event suggestions.
